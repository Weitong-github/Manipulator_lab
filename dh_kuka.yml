# use key f: for initial fixed transform and e: for final fixed transform
# for joints, just use joint number as 1: 2: etc.
notation: [alpha, a, theta, r]
joint:
    f: [0,0,0,0]
    1: [pi, 0, q1, a]
    2: [pi/2, b, q2, 0]
    3: [0, c, q3+pi/2, 0]
    4: [-pi/2, d, q4, e]
    5: [pi/2, 0, q5, 0]
    6: [-pi/2, 0, q6, 0]
    e: [pi, 0, 0, f]
