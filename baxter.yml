# use key f: for initial fixed transform and e: for final fixed transform
# for joints, just use joint number as 1: 2: etc.
notation: [alpha, a, theta, r]
joint:
    1: [0, 0, q1, 0]
    2: [-pi/2, a2, q2-pi/2, 0]
    3: [-pi/2, 0, q3, r3]
    4: [pi/2, a4, q4, 0]
    5: [-pi/2, 0, q5, r5]
    6: [pi/2, a6, q6, 0]
